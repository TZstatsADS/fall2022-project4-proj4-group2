+ Project summary:  Our project implements the algorithms describled in the given paper Learning fair representations (LFR) and Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma). These models are trained and tested on the  dataset.

**Contribution statement**: 

Shuangxian Li: She implented to A1 (LFR) and tried to  reduce the training time on a small training set in order to get good result. She also implemented the algorithms described in the Maximizing fairness under accuracy constraints (gamma and Fine-gamma) and participate in doing presentaion file.
